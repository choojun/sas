/* The classification variable is specified in the CLASS statement. 
PROC ANOVA does not allow continuous variables 
on the right-hand side of the model. 

The overall F test is significant (F = 14.37, p < 0.0001), 
indicating that the model as a whole accounts 
for a significant portion of the variability in the dependent variable. 
The F test for Strain is significant, 
indicating that some contrast between the means 
for the different strains is different from zero. 
Notice that the Model and Strain F tests are identical, 
since Strain is the only term in the model.

The significant F test for Strain suggests that 
there are differences among the bacterial strains, 
but it does not reveal any information about the nature of the differences. 
You can use mean comparison methods to gather further information. 
The MEANS statement requests comparisons of the means of the Strain levels 
by using Tukeyâ€™s studentized range method.
